# Guy Bot

A friendly Discord bot that helps server members use more inclusive language.

## How Does it Work?

When a user sends a message in a Discord channel that includes a word that is
less than inclusive (i.e. "guys", "bros", "dudes", "chaps", etc.) in the
first 10 or last 5 words, a `guy-bot` reaction is added to the message and a
DM is sent to the author with the following:

> Please bear in mind that the makeup of the {server name here} Discord server
> is very diverse, and some people feel excluded by the use of the term
> “{OFFENDING WORD}”. Maybe you could try using people, team, all, folks,
> everyone, or yall? Thanks for helping us make sure everyone feels welcome
> here.

If that user sends another message that includes a non-inclusive word in the
first 10 or last 5 words within a month, that message will also receive a
`guy-bot` reaction, but the message will be sent in the channel for everyone
to see. Example:

> {author mentioned here}, Please bear in mind that the makeup of the
> {server name here} Discord server is very diverse, and some people
> feel excluded by the use of the term “{OFFENDING WORD}”. Maybe you could
> try using people, team, all, folks, everyone, or yall? Thanks for helping us
> make sure everyone feels welcome here.
